# View Events

All rendered views have associated events that are announced whenever the view is rendered via ColdBox Interceptors. These are great ways for you to be able to intercept when views are rendered and transform them, append to them, or even remove content from them in a completely decoupled approach. The way to listen for events in ColdBox is to write Interceptors, which are essential simple CFC's that by convention have a method that is the same name as the event they would like to listen to. Each event has the capability to receive a structure of information wich you can alter, append or remove from. Once you write these Interceptors you can either register them in your Configuration File or programmatically.

| Event | Data | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| preViewRender | view - The name of the view to render | Executed before a view is about to be rendered |
| postViewRender | All of the data above plus: | Executed after a view was rendered |

> **Caution** You can disable the view events on a per-rendering basis by passing the `prePostExempt` argument as true when calling `renderView()` methods.

## Sample Interceptor

Here is a sample interceptor that trims any content before it is rendered:

```javascript
component{

    function postViewRender(event,interceptData){
        interceptData.renderedView = trim( interceptData.renderedView );
    }
}
```

Of course, I am pretty sure you will be more creative than that!
