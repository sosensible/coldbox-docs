# Implicit Layout-View Declarations

Now that we have seen what layouts and views are, where they are located and some samples, let's dig deeper. Let's discover the power of implicit layout/view declarations:

```javascript
//Register Layouts
layouts = [
    { name = "login",
      file = "Layout.tester.cfm",
      views = "vwLogin,test",
      folders = "tags,pdf/single"
    }
];
```

This `layouts` setting allows you to implicitly define layout to view/folder assignments without the need of programmatically doing it. This is a time saver and a nice way to pre-define how certain views will be rendered. Let's see more examples:

```javascript
//Register Layouts
layouts = [
    { name = "Popup",
       file = "Layout.Popup.cfm",
      views = "login,test",
      folders = "^tags,pdf/single"
    },
    { name = "help",
      file = "layout.help.cfm",
      folders = "^help"
    }
];
```

In the sample, we declare the layout named `popup` and points to the file `Layout.Popup.cfm`. We can then assign it to views or folders:

* `Views` : The views to assign to this layout \(no cfm extension\)
* `Folders` : The folders and its children to assign to this layout. \(regex ok\)

This is cool, we can tell the framework that some views and some folders should be rendered within a specific layout. Wow, this opens the possibility of creating nested applications that need different rendering schemas!
